# Project 4 Digital Devination

For this project, it was a project related to code class project titled Digital Devination was to use 
Javascript to create a browser-based divining experience. My divination does not have to be spiritual 
or religious. But I wanted to create something that is spiritual, cultural, or religious.

## Design Process

For my deisgn process I wanted to share something kind of related to spritiual or religious material
that is known to everyone in the world. Which is the famous tarot card that we pick daily. I also have
random tarot cards that I bought and pick 3 cards out of the deck for the day and choose 2 out of them
and believe this will be my luck for today. Then I started desinging this in my head to test this out to
everyone by creating my site with tarot card game interaction type of it. Many people in my country enjoys
going to tarot card readers in the streets or fortune tellers and some truly believes in them and pays
montly to make the wish stronger. My design of the game was firstly made into unity 2d game style and looked
for videos of making and adding or flipping of cards in javascript.

## Refelction

The project was fun as the topic was something I chose and something I wnated people to try out to. The
javascript coding was the hard part where I struggled a lot because I have made the game style I want with
the tools that I am used to called unity 2d game. However the motions that I wanted to have in my site was
somehow different such as flipping and changing and appearing words were not able to be in a part of the 
project as I was not able to cooperate them in javascript but if I got the time to do will improve them in time.
